As mentioned in my recent [blog post](https://dmeister.github.io/blog/2020/05/23/pformat-talk/), I wrote [pformat](https://github.com/dmeister/pformat), a small formatting library that doesn't try to be a general-purpose log library with all bells and whistles but one optimized for log messages.

```cpp
std::string s = "foo {} bar"_fmt(10); // foo 10 bar
```

The main idea was to make it easy to use and compile-time checked. After my talk for [Pure Storage Prague](https://blog.purestorage.com/pure-lands-in-prague/), questions were asked about the compile-time performance.

In that blog post, I used the bloat test from the [format-benchmark](https://github.com/dmeister/format-benchmark) to measure it and the results were quite eye-opening.

This blog post looks at the improvements done and what the results are.

# Step 0: Changing the build machine

I will later move to C++20 (for reasons that will become apparent later). I don't have C++20 on my old MacBook. So, all new experiments are done on a machine with 4-core, i7 at 2.6 GHz, running Ubuntu 2004 using gcc-9.3:

Let's repeat the measurements for calibration:

Method        |Compile Time, s | Compile Time, s (on old machine)
--------------|----------------|---------------------------------
printf        |            3.2 |              5.3
printf+string |           24.5 |             47.6
IOStreams     |           33.2 |             95.1
fmt           |           37.0 |             74.9
compiled_fmt  |           37.2 |             66.0
tinyformat    |           75.3 |            136.3
Boost Format  |          244.4 |            353.4
Folly Format  |          261.4 |            380.4
stb_sprintf   |            3.7 |              6.9
pformat       |           69.5 |            130.0

The changes lie between roughly 1/3 (Folly Format) and 2/4 (IOstreams).
I treat this as the new baseline

# Step 1: Changing the experiment

In the last test, I used the bloat test script. However, I am not a fan of the experiment design.
The files are arbitrarily small. Just including <string> changes the results
in a meaningful way. Now, files like <vector> or <string> will be included in many or most source files.
We pay the cost for including them using one of the libraries or not.

I propose changing the experiment to put more emphasis on the formatting compile-time than on the include files. Each translation unit now has 20 instead of 5 format statements, with 1 to 5 arguments.
I am now also throwing one log message into the mix that has 10 format parameters. Why one and not 4 as with the other argument counts? My statistics over the Pure code base show that a larger number of arguments exist, but they are much rarer than 1-5 arguments.

Now, changing a benchmark in the middle is always suspicions, but stay with me.
My argument is a) the change makes the benchmark more realistic
and b) "my approach" looks relatively speaking, worse with the new benchmark.
So, this wasn't done to fudge the numbers.

I am open to a better benchmark. I would not base my PhD thesis on
this benchmark to be honest, but it is what we have:

Method        |Compile Time, s | Compile Time, s (previous benchmark)
--------------|----------------|---------------------------------
printf        |            4.8 |              3.2
printf+string |           28.7 |             24.5
IOStreams     |           41.9 |             33.2
fmt           |           47.5 |             37.0
compiled_fmt  |           58.7 |             37.2
tinyformat    |           94.0 |             75.3
Boost Format  |          337.2 |            244.4
Folly Format  |          349.3 |            261.4
stb_sprintf   |           5.5  |              3.7
pformat       |          140.7 |             69.5


The changes in the benchmark make a huge difference. Remember before, pformat was on par with tinyformat? Not anymore.
The compile times of fmt, tinyformat, printf, stb_sprintf are pretty much constant. The changes in the number of log lines do not make a difference, but they do for pformat and maybe folly. The design of the experiment matters.

pformat now looks much worse. It should be clear by now that the experiment
wasn't changed to make pformat look better.

# Step 2: Removal of unnecessary includes

Where does pformat spend the 294 seconds?
Clang’s [-ftime-trace](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/agv34v/timetrace_timeline_flame_chart_profiler_for_clang/) can help.

![clang -ftime-trace results](/post_img/2020-06-07-timetrace.png)

We spend 1.9s on each translation unit. Around 650ms on includes, 350 ms on instantiations of functions (we see the recursive next calls in the graph). In the end, we spent 820 milliseconds on the backend.

Let’s tackle the easy task first: Removal of unnecessary includes. pformat has several unnecessary includes. I just didn't check for them at all.

If we zoom into a single translation unit, this change reduces the include processing time to 400ms and the overall time to 1.7s.

I do not want to spend too much time here. There are no obviously unnecessary includes left. All header files which remain will be included by most files anyway, e.g. string_view. It is also not technically interesting.

# Step 3: Get rid of recursive template instantiations

The big pain point and especially the pain point which doesn’t scale is the recursive template instantiation.
So, the new design tries to keep the advantages of the original approach, but relies much less on template metaprogramming and uses constexpr functions instead.

The old approach tried to preserve as much information as possible into the type system. There is the type system for `foo {} bar {}` -> `format_result<ref to str, format_element<0, 4>, format_parameter<0>, format_element<6, 10>,format_parameter>>`.

This forced many template instantiations and they are not needed for performance.

We still want to do the parsing at compile-time and give the runtime/optimizer all or most information to work with, but now we are doing in normal variables. The format result type is now `format_result<n>` which `n` being the estimated number of format elements/format parameter pairs. Each format element now stores the start and end index in variables.

When we look at a translation unit in detail, we see that all the instantiations take around 400-500ms. Each log message instantiation takes between 2-4 ms. It appears that the time isn't linear to the length of the log message. This indicates to me that the actual instantiation takes so much time and not so much the execution of the constexpr functions. No idea what clang is doing for 2-4 milliseconds. I am a software engineer of storage systems. In that time you can persistently perform around 10 IO operations. 4 milliseconds is a long time.

Anyway, the parsing is no longer the issue. We see between the 500-650ms
timestamp all the format_to calls. The runtime of each call is essentially
split up into the instantiation for forward_as_tuple and the visitors.

The good news is that these are no longer done per log message, but
per log parameter type combination. The experiment is designed to have some reuse. Looking at the log messages in the Pure Storage code base,
this appears to be a realistic assumption.

# Step 4: Optimize format/visit function templates

The next major change is to get rid of the recursive template instantiation in the visit function, which is called when doing the actual formatting.

In C++, we have fold expressions, which compile much faster.

Here is an example of the code where we test if we can format all parameter types.
The old code is:

```cpp
template <typename type_t, typename... type_rest_t>
constexpr bool test_placements_helper() {
    constexpr auto placeable = is_placeable<type_t>();
    static_assert(placeable, "Type type_t not placeable");
    if constexpr (!placeable) {
        return false;
    } else if constexpr (sizeof...(type_rest_t) == 0) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return test_placements_helper<type_rest_t...>();
    }
}

template <typename... type_t>
constexpr bool test_placements() {
    if constexpr (sizeof...(type_t) == 0) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return internal::test_placements_helper<type_t...>();
    }
}
```

While this code uses C++17's if constexpr, it completely ignored
fold expressions as another important feature of C++17. The new
code used that:

```cpp
template <typename... type_t>
constexpr bool test_placements() {
    return (internal::is_placeable<type_t>() && ...);
}
```

The code is shorter, has much faster compilation (it appears that way at least), and once you get used to it, is much cleaner.

The main code used the following approach for concat together the output
string from the format elements and format results:

```cpp
auto t = std::forward_as_tuple(std::forward<args_t>(args)...);

parse_result_t::visit(
    [this, &buf](auto fe) {
        using placement::unsafe_place;
        buf = unsafe_place(buf,
                           parse_result.str().data() + fe.start,
                           fe.size());
    },
    [&buf, &t](auto pe) {
        using placement::unsafe_place;
        auto const &arg = std::get<pe.index>(t);
        buf = unsafe_place(buf, arg);
    });

//[...]

template <typename element_func_t, typename parameter_func_t>
inline static constexpr void visit(element_func_t &&ev,
                                   parameter_func_t &&pv) {
    static_assert(is_valid_format_string());
    visit_helper<element_func_t, parameter_func_t, element_t...>(
        std::forward<element_func_t>(ev),
        std::forward<parameter_func_t>(pv));
}

template <typename ev_t, typename pv_t, typename first_t,
          typename... rest_t>
inline static constexpr void visit_helper(ev_t &&ev, pv_t &&pv) {
    if constexpr (first_t::type == format_type::PARAMETER) {
        pv(first_t{});
    } else {
        ev(first_t{});
    }
    visit_helper<ev_t, pv_t, rest_t...>(std::forward<ev_t>(ev),
                                        std::forward<pv_t>(pv));
}

template <typename ev_t, typename pv_t>
inline static constexpr void visit_helper(ev_t &&, pv_t &&) {
    return;
}
```

What took so long to compile were the visit_helper recursive
templates themselves and the forward_as_tuple standard library call.

The new approach changes the order instead of iterating over the
format_result entries and try to find the right argument from the tuple
to format, it iterates over the arguments and finds the right format_result
to place into the output string:

```cpp
template <typename func_t,
          typename... args_t>
inline constexpr void visit(func_t && func,
                            args_t &&... args) const {
    if constexpr (sizeof...(args) == 0) {
        func(string_view_of(results)));
    } else {
        auto result = results.begin();
        auto visit_helper = [this, &result, &func](auto &&arg) {
            if (!result->empty()) {
                func(string_view_of(*result));
            }
            result++;
            func(std::forward<decltype(arg)>(arg));
        };
        (visit_helper(args), ...);
        if (!result->empty()) {
            func(string_view_of(*result));
        }
    }
}
```

The parameter `args` is the arguments passed in by the caller to the format function.
We have to walk through the format element and call the `ev` lambda
For format elements and the pv lambda for the parameter. We call
The visit_helper as fold function, which maintains its state when to
call the lambdas.

That the format functions are still variadic template-based is unfortunate, but hardly
avoidable. The design was meant so that any type that provides an unsafe_place function
can be called. So any variant or union or type identifier based approach is difficult. Maybe there are ways, but I don't see them yet.

# Step 5: Remove static asserts

The old code has many static asserts, which I used as compile-time unit tests.
As much as I like the fast feedback, we should not do that in each translation unit that uses format. Instead, I moved them to extra translation units, which assert when the unit tests are built.

Where do these changes bring us?

Method            |Compile Time, s |
------------------|----------------|
printf            |            4.8 |
printf+string     |           28.7 |
IOStreams         |           41.9 |
fmt               |           47.5 |
compiled_fmt      |           58.7 |
tinyformat        |           94.0 |
Boost Format      |          337.2 |
Folly Format      |          349.3 |
stb_sprintf       |           5.5  |
pformat (orig)    |          140.7 |
pformat (changed) |           65.5 |

The changes really changed the picture.
pformat compiles now faster than tinyformat and is seconds
away (but still smaller than the compiled usage of fmt).

# hana_format

While working on these changes, doing the measurements and writing this post, 
on May 25, Hana Dusikova posted an interesting Tweet with a link to
godbolt.com proposing something similar using C++20 syntax:

## Switching to gcc-10

I want to compare that code, which I call hana_format, with pformat
and the other libraries:

Let's do this step-by-step again. These are the results with gcc-10 and C++17 support.

Method            |Compile time, s |Compile Time, s (gcc-9.3) |
------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
printf            |            4.8 |                      4.8 |
printf+string     |           27.4 |                     28.7 |
IOStreams         |           38.6 |                     41.9 |
fmt               |           35.6 |                     47.5 |
compiled_fmt      |           35.4 |                     58.7 |
tinyformat        |           83.5 |                     94.0 |
Boost Format      |          311.0 |                    337.2 |
Folly Format      |          338.8 |                    349.3 |
stb_sprintf       |            6.0 |                     5.5  |
pformat (changed) |           70.4 |                     65.5 |

Most appear to be slightly faster (except pformat), but I will call
it within the margin of error for now.

## Switching to C++20

These are the results with gcc-10 for C++20.

Method            |Compile time, s |Compile Time, s (C++17)   |
------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
printf            |            4.2 |                      4.8 |

IOStreams         |           62.1 |                     38.6 |
fmt               |           59.4 |                     35.6 |

Boost Format      |          XXXXX |                    311.0 |
Folly Format      |          362.8 |                    338.8 |
stb_sprintf       |            5.7 |                      6.0 |
pformat (changed) |          111.7 |                     70.4 |
hana_format       |          187.0 |                          |

First, Boost Format stopped compiling. I gave up at some point
and removed it. It was strangely slow anyway.

Secondly, compilation times increased all over the board. Well,
at least for all C++ approaches. pformat from 70 seconds to 111 seconds, fmt from around 30 seconds to 60 seconds.

I can only speculate why hana_format is slower. This was very surprising.
The code has a handwritten state machine to parse the grammar. In hana_format,
the grammar takes a lambda to decide what to do with it, e.g. count the number of parameter or put characters into the output buffer. All in all the format string is parsed three times at compile-time.

In contrast, pformat does a quick guess at the beginning to get an upper bound on the number of format elements, then parses the grammar and puts it into the format results. When the output string is build these intermediate results are used instead of parsing the format string again. I suspect this difference will make up much of the difference.

I am still amazed how fast the fmt library is.

## Runtime performance

Compile-time was one element, but the three pillars of
pformat were compile-time checking, extensibility and performance.

To finish this up, let's look at runtime performance. pformat
as a benchmark, which formats the string "foo {} bar {} do {}" with
three arguments (int, int, const char *) into a char buffer.

```
BM_Fmt/1               67.3 ns         67.3 ns      8767537

```

Compared to the earlier results, pformat is now a bit slower.
Looking at the assembly still shows that the optimizer
can make sense out of the information, which has
been computed at compile-time and generates quite good code,
but there is a bit more noise then before. It isn't ideal anymore.

However, it is still faster than fmt and effectively even than
hana_format. The latter is so surprising because the assembly of both
looks well optimized. The results are so close, I would account that as measurement
error.

Compared to an approach which incurred way to high a cost at compile-time,
this is likely a price worth paying.

With three ideas, I improved the compile-time of pformat
about around 50%.

- Carefully look at the included files. I usually would be wary
of not using some standard tools like string_view in the hope of
improving compile-times, but maybe there are cases where every ms counts
and one has to assume that e.g. string_view will not be included at all.
- Avoid unnecessary template instantiations. Especially recursive template
  instantiations.
- Use fold expressions as they appear to be much faster to compile. This is likely
  because the compile doesn't have to instantiate all the templates to do so.

This journey shows my fallacy of running to extensive template metaprogramming
when I should have trusted the compiler, trusted modern C++, and used
constexpr and let the compiler do its job.

The new code can be found in the [lesstemplate branch of pformat](https://github.com/dmeister/pformat/tree/lesstemplates). I will
likely clean that up a bit more and push it to master soon.

I never worked with compile-time programming before pformat. It was an
experiment if something like that is possible. And I never looked into
compile-time programming. Usually, this is treated as a problem I
can solve with hardware. However, if your algorithm is quadratic, this
becomes expensive very fast and after some point even impossible to do.

Also, the time-trace tool in clang is very helpful to make compile-time
improvements engineering work and not guesswork.
