# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal blog built with Hugo using the PaperMod theme. The blog is hosted on GitHub Pages at https://dmeister.github.io/blog/.

## Architecture

This is a static site generator project using Hugo with the following structure:

- **`content/posts/`**: Blog posts in Markdown format with YYYY-MM-DD-title.md naming convention
  - Posts use front matter with `title:` and `date:` fields
  - Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
  - Content is written in Markdown

- **`content/`**: Other pages (about, archives, search)
  - `about.md`: About page with author information
  - `archives.md`: Archive page showing all posts
  - `search.md`: Search functionality page

- **`themes/PaperMod/`**: Hugo PaperMod theme (installed as git submodule)
  - Modern, clean theme optimized for blogs
  - Supports dark mode, search, and archives out of the box

- **`static/`**: Static assets (images, files)
  - `post_img/`: Images used in blog posts
  - Files here are served directly at the root of the site

- **`hugo.toml`**: Hugo configuration file
  - Site title: "Dirk Meister"
  - Base URL: https://dmeister.github.io/blog/
  - Pagination: 5 posts per page
  - Theme: PaperMod
  - Menu items: About, Archive, Search
  - Social icons for Twitter and email

- **`public/`** (legacy): Old Jekyll public directory - no longer used by Hugo
- **`_posts/`, `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, `_config.yml`** (legacy): Old Jekyll files - kept for reference but not used

## Development Workflow

### Creating a New Post

1. Create a new file in `content/posts/` with naming format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md`
2. Add front matter at the top:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Your Post Title
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   ---
   ```
3. Write content in Markdown below the front matter
4. Test locally with `hugo server`
5. Build with `hugo` command
6. Commit and push to master branch

### Local Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server with live reload
hugo server

# Start development server and include draft posts
hugo server -D

# Build site to public/ directory (for deployment)
hugo

# Create a new post
hugo new content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md
```

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Serve site locally at http://localhost:1313/blog/
hugo server

# The site will automatically reload when you make changes
```

### Git Workflow

- Main branch: `master`
- The PaperMod theme is added as a git submodule in `themes/PaperMod`
- To update the theme: `git submodule update --remote themes/PaperMod`

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Hugo sites require a build step. You'll need to set up GitHub Actions to build and deploy:

1. Create `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` for automated deployment
2. Or build locally with `hugo` and push the `public/` directory
3. Configure GitHub Pages to serve from the appropriate branch/folder

## Important Notes

- Hugo uses `content/` instead of Jekyll's `_posts/` directory
- Front matter uses `date:` instead of Jekyll's `layout: post`
- Theme is installed as a git submodule, not directly in the repository
- The `public/` directory is generated by Hugo and should typically be gitignored (unless deploying manually)
- Raw HTML in Markdown is enabled via `markup.goldmark.renderer.unsafe = true`
- PaperMod theme provides built-in support for:
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Search functionality (requires JSON output)
  - Archive page
  - Social media icons
  - Reading time estimates
  - Code copy buttons
