Last week was my last week at [Pure Storage](https://purestorage.com).

Seven 1/2 years ago I joined Pure Storage working from a small chamber in the UK waiting for the US visa situation to work out.
The overall engineering team consisted of a couple of dozen of engineers at the time.

Since then, the company grow many times over, and I had the opportunity to contribute to different parts of the company and the [FlashArray product](https://www.purestorage.com/products/nvme/flasharray-x.html): From replication and data protection to the file system and since 2020 internal Engineering Productivity.
In this time, I worked with exceptional engineers and managers.
I learned a lot from them and I grow a lot as an engineer and as a technical leader.
I am proud of what we have built in these years: The FlashArray is just an amazing storage system.

However, last Tuesday marked my last day at Pure Storage.
Next month, I will join the Engineering Productivity team at [Databricks](https://databricks.com).

What the Databricks team has built over the years is already truly impressive, and I excited to see what comes next.
With an engineering team that is growing at the rate Databricks has grown and is growing, the engineering processes and tooling are critical to translate engineering team growth into sustained productivity and innovation.
I am excited to join them.
